<h2>Rendering</h2>
All of the following are relevant just for the OpenGL 2.0 render path:
<ul>
<li>Added support for specular textures an normal maps for meshes</li>
<li>Enabled display of eclipse shadows cast onto meshes</li>
<li>Enabled per-pixel specular lighting for higher-quality specular highlights,
   i.e. fewer tessellation artifacts. This is especially noticeable with
    low polygon models with specular materials.</li>
<li>Normal maps and specular materials can now be applied at the same time,
    for 'bumpy-shiny' effects</li>
<li>Simulated scattering, for much more realistic rendering of planetary
    atmospheres.</li>
<li>Implemented a Lunar-Lambert photometric model for more realistic rendering
    of dust covered bodies such as the moon.</li>
<li>Added support for compressed normal maps; eliminates the need to use huge
    amounts of texture memory for high quality normal maps</li>
</ul>


<h2>Flexible reference frames</h2>
<ul>
<li>Celestia now supports flexible reference frames for specifying object
    trajectories and orientations. This makes it easier to import new objects
    into Celestia that have orbits defined in some reference frame other than
    the default ones enforced in 1.4.1.</li>
<li>New reference frames:
<ul>
    <li>J2000Ecliptic: defined by the ecliptic and equinox of J2000.0. This
      is the default for objects orbiting stars. It may now be specified for
      other objects as well.</li>
    <li>J2000Equator: defined by the Earth equator and ecliptic of J2000.0.</li>
    <li>MeanEquator: reference frame defined by the equator of some arbitrary
      object. This was previously the default and only reference frame available
      for solar system bodies that didn't directly orbit stars.</li>
    <li>BodyFixed: a reference frame that rotates with smoe specified object</li>
    <li>TwoVector: a flexible system for defining reference frames based on two
      vectors, either a constant vector, object-to-object direction, or
      velocity vector. Useful for local attitude frames (among other things.)</li>
</ul></li>
  <li>Separate reference frames may be defined for the position and orientation
    of an object. As an example, it may be useful to specify the trajectory of
    an Earth-orbiting satellite in an Earth equatorial frame while its attitude
    is specified in an LVLH frame.</li>
  <li>A new solar system object called a ReferencePoint is available. This is
    useful for defining the origin of a reference frame that doesn't happen
    to lie at the center of a planet, moon, or spacecraft.
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>New trajectory types</h2>
<ul>
<li>FixedPosition: For placing an object at a fixed point within its reference
    frame.</li>
<li>ScriptedOrbit: Allows the position of an object to be controlled by a Lua
    script.</li>
<li>SampledTrajectory: A more flexible version of SampledOrbit, with the option
    to specify single or double precision and cubic or linear interpolation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New rotation models</h2>
<ul>
<li>In previous versions of Celestia, all objects rotated uniformly about a
    single axis (with optional precession about the z-axis.) Celestia 1.5.0
    introduces the concept of a generic rotation model, which is some function
    that specifies the orientation of an object over time.</li>
<li>Rotation models available in Celestia 1.5.0:
<ul>
    <li>FixedRotation: For an object with an orientation that remains fixed
      within its reference frame. This was a notable omission in older version
      of Celestia.</li>
    <li>UniformRotation: Describes a rotation of a constant rate about a fixed
      axis.</li>
    <li>PrecessingRotation: UniformRotation plus a precession rate.</li>
    <li>SampledOrientation: Analagous to SampledOrbit for position.
      SampledOrientation specifies a file of time tagged quaternions which
      are interpolated to give the orientation of an object.</li>
    <li>ScriptedRotation: Allows the orientation of an object to be controlled
      by a Lua script.</li>
</ul></li></ul>

<h2>Galaxies</h2>
<ul>
<li>Catalog improvements:
<ul>
<li>Included the complete local group of galaxies.</li>
<li>Updated catalog so that nearly 100% of galaxies now have distances.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Added support for custom galaxy templates; created a custom Milky Way
    template with all known galactic arms.</li>
<li>Improved appearance of Milky Way as seen from Earth.</li>
<li>Accelerated loading of large catalog files by using an improve name index
    (measured over 100x performance increase for 100k+ object catalogs)</li>
<li>Implemented distance-based fading of labels.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Data file updates</h2>
<ul>
</li>Extrasolar planets: added about 50 recently discovered extrasolar planets,
    and revised orbits of known ones based on new data.
    data.</li>
<li>Solar System: Added newly discovered outer planet satellites and names.</li>
<li>Locations: Added new IAU names for features on planets, moons, and asteroids.</li>
<li>Near stars: Updated near star catalog with latest data from RECONS.</li>
<li>Binary stars: Updated the binary orbit data in visual and spectroscopic binary
    catalogs, and included scripts that document the extraction of information
    in scientific data sets for use in Celestia star catalogs.</li>
<li>A new set of higher resolution textures was added for the Moon and several
    satellites of Saturn.</li>
</ul>

<h2>CELX Scripting improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>OpenGL drawing commands allow scripts to display custom graphics on screen.</li>
<li>ScriptedOrbits and ScriptedRotations provide hooks for objects to be
    positioned and oriented with scripts.</li>
<li>The Lua hook mechanism gives CELX scripts the ability to handle mouse,
    keyboard, and tick events.</li>
<li>Many other CELX functions to enable scripts to accomplish much of what
    used to be possible only by modifying the Celestia source code.</li>
<li>Scripts may now be loaded quickly from the new Scripts menu.</li>
<li>Updated CELX interpreter from Lua 5.0 to Lua 5.1.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Accuracy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Established Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) as the time scale used
    internally by Celestia.</li>
<li>Established the origin of Celestia's coordinate system as the Solar System
    Barycenter and the reference frame as J2000 ecliptical.</li>
<li>Fixed support for JPL ephemerides. It is now posible to use the JPL
    DE405 and DE406 ephemerides whenever extremely accurate positions for
    the Moon and planets are required.</li>
<li>Added an orbit for the Sun around the solar system barycenter.</li>
</ul>


<h2>SPICE support</h2>
<ul>
<li>Celestia can now use extremely accurate planet orbits and spacecraft
  trajectories available in SPICE SPK files from JPL.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Orbit rendering</h2>
<ul>
<li>Orbits are now properly depth sorted with respect to other solar system
    objects. They are no longer improperly drawn in front of objects that they
    are behind, and vice versa.</li>
<li>The jittering of orbit paths viewed at close distances has been reduced.</li>
<li>Cubic splines are used to reduce the appearance of sharp angles in between
    orbit segments. This also has the effect of placing the rendered orbit path
    much closer to the the actual orbit path.</li>
<li>Star orbit paths are now shown, and may be toggled on and off indepently
    of the orbits for other objects.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Translation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Windows version finally supports multiple languages.</li>
<li>New translations: Ukrainian, Russian, Arabic, Dutch, Chinese, Korean,
    Bulgarian.</li>
<li>All other languages updated.</li>
<li>Added translations for constellations names.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added dynamic star labeling.</li>
<li>Added support for labeled markers and new marker symbols.</li>
<li>Enhanced InfoURLs so that they can refer to local files.</li>
<li>Added the capability to show reference vectors for objects, including
    frame axes, body axes, velocity vector, and sun direction.</li>
<li>Made label and line colors customizable via script.</li>
<li>Better time control: Shift+K and Shift+L can be used to reduce or increase the time rate by a factor of 2.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Bug fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the video recording rate on Windows.<li>
<li>Bad calculation of specular exponent when loading 3DS models. This caused
    models with specular materials to look very different in Celestia than they
    did in 3D modeling software.</li>
<li>Fixed precision problems that caused location labels to disappear and
    jitter at close range.</li>
<li>Implemented more robust handling of script errors so that they don't
    cause Celestia to crash.</li>
<li>Allow scripts to run before the first frame is rendered so that they can
    set the starting observer position.</li>
<li>Switched to double precision for rotation and precession periods; among
    other things, this keeps synchronous rotators from drifting out of sync.</li>
<li>Implemented adaptive tesselation for comet tails based on their size on
    screen. This makes comet tails appear smooth when seen up close.</li>
<li>Clamped the simulation time to prevent going too far into the past or future.</li>
<li>Fixed the cmod loader to work properly on 64-bit systems. A nasty bug was
    preventing 64-bit Linux versions of Celestia from displaying spacecraft.</li>
<li>Fixed problems with the displayed time rate getting out of sync with the
    actual time rate.</li>
</ul>
