<title>New Features in Celestia 1.6.0</title>

<h1>New Features in Celestia 1.6.0</h1>

<div class="main">

<h2>Planetshine</h2>
<div class="imgFloatRight">
<a href="images/hubble-planetshine.png"><img src="images/th-hubble-planetshine.png"><a><br>

</div>
<p>
In previous versions of Celestia, the only source of illumination was the sun
(or suns, in multiple star systems.) But, light reflected from the surface of
a planet can also be a significant. If you look at images of the International
Space Station, you'll notice that the Earth-facing portion is lit by a bluish
light reflected from the Earth's oceans. Recent images from the Cassini mission
show the moons of Saturn with one hemisphere illuminated by the faint glow
of Saturnshine. You can now observe these effects in the latest version of
Celestia as well.
</p>

<h2>Globular clusters</h2>
<div class="imgFloatLeft">
<a href="images/m5.png"><img src="images/th-m5.png"></a><br>
Globular cluster M5
</div>
<p>
Much work has been done to add a globular cluster catalog to the new
version of Celestia. The catalog contains all 150 globular clusters of
the Milky Way. The appearance of each cluster based on its measured diameter,
core diameter, and King concentration (a parameter which gives the
variation in star density with distance from cluster center.)
</p>

<h2>New sky grids</h2>
<p>
Celestia's sky grid feature has been completely rewritten and greatly
improved. The spacing of lines in the grid will now
adapt to the field of view, making it a much better tool for orienting yourself
at high zoom levels. Coordinate labels are conveniently located at the edges of
the view window. Celestia supports grids for several different coordinate
systems, including equatorial, horizontal (altitude/azimuth), galactic, and
ecliptic.
</p>

<h2>Selection cursor</h2>
<p>
A new animated cursor in 1.6.0 makes Celestia easier to use. The animation
effect directs your eye to the selected item more quickly. An arrow at border
of the view window points to the selection when it is offscreen. And, the
cursor changes color when the selection is hidden by a foreground object. This
visual cue helps you locate the selection in three dimensions.
</p>

<h2>Triaxial ellipsoids</h2>
<div class="imgFloatRight">
<a href="images/haumea.png"><img src="images/th-haumea.png"></a><br>
Elongated shape of dwarf planet Haumea
</div>
<p>
While the shaped of most large objects in the solar system are closely
approximated by flattened spheres, there are some exotic worlds that are
noticeably elongated along one axis. The most extreme example of this is
the dwarf planet Haumea (aka 2003 EL 61), which looks more like an American
football than a familiarly spherical planet. Now that Celestia supports
triaxial ellipsoid bodies, you can see the true appearance of such worlds.
</p>

<h2>Orbit color</h2>
<p>
Different orbit colors may be assigned for each object in a solar system.
This can help you quickly distinguish the orbits of individual planets. Or,
you can highlight the orbits of a group of related objects.
</p>

<h2>Dwarf planets</h2>
<p>
Since 2006, the International Astronomical Union has recognized a new class
of object called a dwarf planet. To date, there are five bodies in our Solar
System that have been assigned dwarf planet status. Version 1.6.0 brings
Celestia up to date with the IAU decision and adds a dwarf planet class. You
can visit all five dwarf planets and their known satellites.
</p>

<h2>New reference marks</h2>
<div class="imgFloatLeft">
<a href="images/dione-refmark.png"><img src="images/th-dione-refmark.png"></a><br>
Terminator and planetographic grid
</div>
<p>
Reference marks augment the 3D view with additional information that
can help you understand the locations and relationships between solar system
objects. Celestia 1.6.0 adds a longitude/latitude grid to aid in locating
surface features. Another new reference mark is the terminator, the
boundary between the day and night sides of a world.
</p>

<h2>Updated Cassini mission</h2>
<p>
The primary mission of the Cassini spacecraft lasted through mid-2008. In
April 2008, an two-year extended mission was approved. The new version of
Celestia includes the extended mission trajectory, so that you can follow
Cassini around Saturn through 2010. The Huygens probe separation sequence has
been improved using new features in version 1.6.0&mdash;watch Huygens separate from
the main Cassini spacecraft and rendezvous with Titan three weeks later.
</p>

<h2>Updated ISS model</h2>
<div class="imgFloatRight">
<a href="images/iss-new.png"><img src="images/th-iss-new.png"></a><br>
New ISS model
</div>
<p>
The new Celestia package includes a much more detailed model of the
International Space Station, complete with all the modules added through
2008. With the new planetshine feature in 1.6.0, the updated ISS looks
spectacular in low Earth orbit.
